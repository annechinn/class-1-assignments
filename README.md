# Introduction

This GitBook is used to easily create the markdown for the README.md for all of the assignment templates used across our courses.

### General Steps

1. Create the template in this GitBook
2. Save/Merge the changes
3. Create a new template repository in the course master organization for the assignment
4. Copy the code from this page into the README.md of the template assignment
5. Commit the changes to the template assignment.
6. Copy the template assignment into the course instance organization and mark it as a template repository 
7. Use the template repository to create an assignment in for the class.
8. If you need to make a modification to the markdown for the assignment README.md, just back to step 2 and start again.

Note: It should be possible to just refer to the assignment template repo from teh master organization when selecting a repo as the starter code for the assignment, but it was causing errors when testing a student accepting the assignment. After reading some similar complaints on the forums, the general suggestion was to copy the template repo from the master organization to the class template organization and then use that one as the basis for the assignment. 

This actually may be the preferred mechanism, as it would be good to get to a place where you could copy all the assignment templates to the class organization at the beginning of the class, and then you would be free to modify the master assignment templates for future runs of the class, as well as modify the class versions for the current class if necessary.
